# Emoji Regular Expression Patterns

This project was created to maintain a set of regular expressions that can be used to match all possible emoji code points and sequences.  

It is a work in progress. Need to build a test suite for PHP, as well as extending the tests to match more difficult scenerios like a group of emoji sequences placed side by side. It would also be nice to add regular expressions for more languages.

#### Usage

Build JavaScript regex from src

`npm run babel`

Run Javascript tests

`npm run test`

Output PHP in the console

`php src/php/index.php`
